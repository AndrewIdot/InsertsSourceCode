## Vs The Inserts Source Code
the most epicest of fails in human history

to play go to the export folder and then the bin one, most complete shit is there



sometimes I wish I didnt combine vs fab with vs andrew and skem
maybe the mod would have actually released

what is wrong with me

fun fact: after this epic failure I've never been able to work on an fnf mod again due to either the team doing LITERALLY NOTHING or me pissed that someone recharted something and leaving (im a fucking idiot)
too bad I cant make good looking/sounding shit on my own either

oh yeah about the team that did literally nothing
